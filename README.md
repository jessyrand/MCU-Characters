# MCU Characters - STD2404

A simple application to manage a list of characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).  
The project is split into two parts:
- **Backend** (Express.js): REST API that stores data in a local JSON file (`characters.json`).
- **Frontend** (React + Vite + Tailwind): User interface to display and manage characters.
